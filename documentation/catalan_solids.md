**Catalan Solids**

Catalan solids are a set of 13 convex polyhedra that are dual to the Archimedean solids. This means that each Catalan solid has the same number of faces as the corresponding Archimedean solid has vertices, and vice versa.

**Key characteristics of Catalan solids:**

* **Face-transitive:** All faces are congruent (identical in shape and size).
* **Not vertex-transitive:** Vertices have different arrangements of faces around them.
* **Convex:** All interior angles are less than 180 degrees.

**The 13 Catalan solids are:**

1. **Rhombic dodecahedron:** Dual to the cuboctahedron.
2. **Rhombic triacontahedron:** Dual to the icosidodecahedron.
3. **Triakis tetrahedron:** Dual to the truncated tetrahedron.
4. **Tetrakis hexahedron:** Dual to the truncated cube.
5. **Pentakis dodecahedron:** Dual to the truncated dodecahedron.
6. **Hexakis octahedron:** Dual to the truncated octahedron.
7. **Disdyakis triacontahedron:** Dual to the truncated icosidodecahedron.
8. **Deltoidal icositetrahedron:** Dual to the rhombicosidodecahedron.
9. **Deltoidal hexacontahedron:** Dual to the rhombicosidodecahedron.
10. **Pentagonal icositetrahedron:** Dual to the truncated cuboctahedron.
11. **Pentagonal hexacontahedron:** Dual to the truncated icosidodecahedron.
12. **Rhombicuboctahedron:** Dual to the snub cube.
13. **Rhombicosidodecahedron:** Dual to the snub dodecahedron.

These solids are named after the Belgian mathematician Eug√®ne Charles Catalan, who first described them in 1865. They are fascinating geometric objects with many applications in art, architecture, and design.
