Mesh modifiers are powerful tools for transforming 3D meshes. They allow you to apply various
geometric operations, such as translation, rotation, scaling, bending, and more. By understanding
the core concepts and how to use these modifiers effectively, you can create a wide range of 3D
shapes and effects.

## Bend Modifier

**Purpose:**

The Bend Modifier is a tool designed to deform a 3D mesh by bending it along the X-axis. It's particularly useful for creating curved shapes or simulating bending effects.

**How it works:**

**Bending Factor:**

The ```factor``` parameter controls the intensity of the bend. A higher factor results in a more pronounced curve.

**Vertex Deformation:**

* For each vertex in the mesh:
* The X-coordinate of the vertex is used to calculate a bending angle.
* The Y and Z coordinates are then modified based on this angle and the ```factor``` to achieve the desired bending effect.

**Using the Bend Modifier:**

1. **Create a Mesh:** Start with a basic 3D mesh, such as a grid, cube, or sphere.
2. **Create the Modifier:** Create an instance of the BendModifier class, specifying the desired bending factor.
3. **Modify the Mesh:** Apply the modify method of the BendModifier to the mesh.

**Example:**

```java
GridCreator creator = new GridCreator();
creator.setSubdivisionsX(10);
creator.setSubdivisionsZ(10);
creator.setTileSizeX(1);
creator.setTileSizeZ(1);

Mesh3D mesh = creator.create(); // Create a grid mesh
BendModifier modifier = new BendModifier(0.5f); // Create a BendModifier with a factor of 0.5

mesh.apply(modifier); // Apply the modifier to the mesh
```

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Extreme Bending:** For very high factor values, the mesh may become distorted or self-intersecting.
* **Mesh Topology:** The effectiveness of the modifier can be influenced by the mesh topology. For complex meshes, additional considerations may be necessary.
* **Combining with Other Modifiers:** The Bend Modifier can be combined with other modifiers to create more complex deformations.

By understanding the basic principles and parameters of the Bend Modifier, you can effectively use it to create a wide range of 3D shapes and effects.

## Push-Pull Modifier

**Purpose:**

The Push-Pull Modifier is a versatile tool for deforming 3D meshes. It allows you to push or pull vertices towards or away 
from a specified center point, creating a variety of effects like bulging, indenting, or extruding parts of the mesh.

**How it works:**

1. **Center Point:** The modifier uses a defined center point as a reference for the deformation.
2. **Distance:** The ```distance``` parameter controls the magnitude of the push or pull. A positive value pushes vertices away from the center, while a negative value pulls them towards the center.
3. **Vertex Deformation:** For each vertex in the mesh:
* The ```distance``` between the vertex and the center point is calculated.
* The vertex is moved along the vector connecting it to the center point, by the specified distance.

**Using the Push-Pull Modifier:**

1. **Create a Mesh:** Start with a basic 3D mesh, such as a plane, cube, or sphere.
2. **Apply the Modifier:** Create an instance of the PushPullModifier class, specifying the desired distance and center point.
3. **Modify the Mesh:** Apply the modify method of the PushPullModifier to the mesh.

**Example:**

```java
// TODO
```

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Mesh Topology:** The effectiveness of the modifier can be influenced by the mesh topology. For complex meshes, additional considerations may be necessary.
* **Combining with Other Modifiers:** The Push-Pull Modifier can be combined with other modifiers to create more complex deformations.

By understanding the basic principles and parameters of the Push-Pull Modifier, you can effectively use it to create a wide range of 3D shapes and effects.

## Translate Modifier

**Purpose:**

The Translate Modifier is a simple yet powerful tool for transforming 3D meshes. It allows you to shift all vertices of a mesh by a specified distance along the X, Y, and Z axes. This is useful for positioning meshes, aligning them with other objects, or creating more complex deformations in combination with other modifiers.

**How it works:**

1. **Translation Vector:** The `deltaX`, `deltaY`, and `deltaZ` parameters define the translation vector, which specifies the amount of shift in each axis.
2. **Vertex Translation:** For each vertex in the mesh, the `deltaX`, `deltaY`, and `deltaZ` values are added to its respective X, Y, and Z coordinates.

**Using the Translate Modifier:**

1. **Create a Mesh:** Start with a basic 3D mesh, such as a plane, cube, or sphere.
2. **Apply the Modifier:** Create an instance of the `TranslateModifier` class, specifying the desired translation values.
3. **Modify the Mesh:** Apply the `modify` method of the `TranslateModifier` to the mesh.

**Example:**

```java
Mesh3D mesh = new CubeCreator().create() // Create a cube mesh
TranslateModifier translateModifier = new TranslateModifier(2, 1, -3); // Create a TranslateModifier with a translation of (2, 1, -3)
mesh.apply(translateModifier); // Apply the modifier to the mesh
```

This will shift the entire cube mesh 2 units along the X-axis, 1 unit along the Y-axis, and -3 units along the Z-axis.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Combining with Other Modifiers:** The Translate Modifier can be combined with other modifiers like Rotate, Scale, or Bend to create more complex deformations.
* **Order of Application:** The order in which modifiers are applied can affect the final result. Experiment with different sequences to achieve desired effects.

By understanding the basic principles and parameters of the Translate Modifier, you can effectively use it to position and manipulate 3D meshes in your projects.
