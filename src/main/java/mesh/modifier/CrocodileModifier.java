/**
 * The `CrocodileModifier` transforms a 3D mesh by applying the Conway Ambo
 * operation and adding spike-like protrusions to the resulting faces.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * - Ambo Operation: This operation slices off the corners of the original
 * polyhedron by creating slicing planes that pass through the midpoints of
 * edges. This produces new vertices and new polygonal faces, effectively
 * generating a new polyhedral structure.
 * 
 * - Spike Creation: After applying the Ambo operation, spike-like protrusions
 * are added to the centers of these newly created faces. These spikes extend
 * outward, giving the resulting mesh a spiky appearance. This spike effect can
 * be viewed as a variation of the Kis operation.
 * 
 * - Kis-Like Operation: While the traditional Kis operation modifies all faces
 * of a polyhedron, this implementation is limited to targeting only the newly
 * created faces resulting from the Ambo operation. This allows for a more
 * focused and controlled deformation.
 * </pre>
