/**
 * Unity tutorial port for procedural landmass generation.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package contains a port of the Unity tutorial series
 * "Procedural Landmass Generation" by Sebastian Lague.
 * The goal of this port is not feature parity, but validation
 * and stress-testing of the engine’s current capabilities.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Purpose</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Evaluate mesh generation workflows</li>
 *   <li>Validate texture handling concepts</li>
 *   <li>Test texture filter modes and wrap modes</li>
 *   <li>Assess architectural flexibility during real-world feature implementation</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Status</h2>
 * <p>
 * The port is incomplete and may evolve as the engine architecture
 * and feature set continue to mature. Adjustments to the implementation
 * are expected as engine abstractions harden and improve.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Architectural Notes</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Adapted from Unity C# scripts to fit the engine’s Java-based architecture</li>
 *   <li>Serves as an integration and validation exercise rather than production code</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package is experimental and not intended as a reference implementation.
 * It exists to explore engine capabilities and guide further architectural decisions.
 * </p>
