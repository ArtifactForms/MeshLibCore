/**
 * Provides experimental sandbox applications and small test games.
 *
 * <p>This package contains small to medium-sized applications whose primary purpose is
 * experimentation and exploration of engine features.
 *
 * <h2>Purpose</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Evaluate engine design decisions
 *   <li>Explore new features and integration scenarios
 *   <li>Provide visual validation of engine functionality
 *   <li>Answer architectural and API design questions
 *   <li>Offer lightweight debug setups
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Non-Goals</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Not production-ready architecture
 *   <li>Not a reference implementation
 *   <li>No guarantee of best practices
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Code in this package exists purely for experimentation, rapid prototyping, and integration
 * testing. It may intentionally trade architectural purity for speed of iteration and practical
 * validation.
